            <h1 id="tituloTexto">HTML</h1>
            <div id="texto">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the backbone of web development, serving as the foundation for creating web pages and applications. Here are some key points about HTML:
                <br>
                <br>
                Structure: HTML uses a structure of tags to define and organize content on a web page. Tags enclose elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links.
                <br>
                <br>
                Semantic Markup: HTML offers semantic tags to describe content meaningfully, enhancing accessibility and SEO. Examples include &lt;header&gt;, &lt;nav&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;footer&gt;.
                <br>
                <br>
                Version Evolution: HTML has evolved over the years, with HTML5 being the latest standard. It introduced many new elements, attributes, and improved multimedia support.
                <br>
                <br>
                Basic Structure: A basic HTML document includes the &lt;!DOCTYPE&gt; declaration, &lt;html&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, and &lt;body&gt; elements. The &lt;head&gt; section contains meta information and links to stylesheets, while the &lt;body&gt; holds visible content.
                <br>
                <br>
                Attributes: HTML elements can have attributes that provide additional information or functionality. For instance, the &lt;img&gt; element uses the "src" attribute to specify the image file.
                <br>
                <br>
                Links: Hyperlinks are created with the &lt;a&gt; tag and the "href" attribute. They connect web pages and resources.
                <br>
                <br>
                Forms: HTML allows the creation of forms for user input, using elements like &lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, and &lt;button&gt;. Form data can be processed on the server.
                <br>
                <br>
                Multimedia: HTML5 brought native support for multimedia, including &lt;audio&gt; and &lt;video&gt; elements, reducing the need for third-party plugins.
                <br>
                <br>
                Compatibility: Modern browsers support HTML5, making it the standard for web development. Developers use polyfills and fallbacks for older browsers.
                <br>
                <br>
                Frameworks and Tools: Developers often use frameworks like Bootstrap and tools like Visual Studio Code to streamline HTML development.
                </div>
            <h1 id="tituloTexto">JavaScript</h1>
            <div id="texto">JavaScript, also known as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
                <br>
                <br>
                JavaScript is primarily used to enhance web pages by making them more dynamic and interactive. It enables developers to create responsive, engaging user experiences. Despite their similar names, Java and JavaScript are two distinct programming languages with different purposes and capabilities. Java is used for desktop applications, on the other hand JavaScript is used for web applications and specially the front-end.
                <br>
                <br>
                It's primarily executed on the front-end (the user's web browser) rather than on the web server, which reduces the load on the server and allows for faster processing.
                <br>
                <br>
                JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language, often used for writing scripts that can be embedded directly into HTML pages. It doesn't require a separate compilation step.
                <br>
                <br>
                JavaScript supports object-oriented programming concepts, and it uses prototypes rather than classes for inheritance.
                <br>
                <br>
                JavaScript is supported by all major web browsers, making it a crucial component for building web applications that can run across different platforms seamlessly.
                <br>
                <br>
JavaScript is well-suited for event-driven programming, enabling developers to create functions that execute in response to specific events, such as clicks or keystrokes.
<br>
                <br>
JavaScript has a rich ecosystem with various libraries and frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue.js that simplify and accelerate web development.
<br>
                <br>
JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be executed independently without blocking the main thread, which is crucial for handling network requests and ensuring smooth user experiences.
